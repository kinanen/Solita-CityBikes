## Process and Room for improvment
The project has been done as a part of application process to Solita Dev Academy, some used tech and libraries used in the project hase been new to me so there has been some ups and downs, and much of learning thruout the process. 
 
 Things I would do otherwise or pay more attention next time: 
  - Spaghetti code in the "Home" component of React app
  - More unified way of working in all components in React app
  - Setting all similar components in same way, for clearer code
  - Using Varibles file in react app rather than passing some props to several components
  - Refiguring Stations, Trips, and TripCounts API modules
  - 

 Left for next time:
  - Finishing Post and Put API's and data validator for the input form for both station and trip
  - E2E tests
  - Simpler and more reliable data read-in
  - revisiting sql table needs and application data usage
  
 Things I am proud of: 
  - Clear map view
  - Simple and well structured code in backend
  - SQL database works as intended + usage of ef core, which was new for me
  - Quick and reasonably easy process of moving app to run on Azure 
  - Clear data views and selection of representable data
